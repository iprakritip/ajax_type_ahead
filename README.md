# Ajax Type Ahead
Completed as a part of Javascsript 30 Wes Bos(Day 6)

## New Learnings
* How string.replace(regex, new value) checks for patterns of regex in data and replaces those patterns
* fetch returns a promise, so promise.json gives us a json format data
* It's better to use keyup instead of keydown and keypress to access complete input value
